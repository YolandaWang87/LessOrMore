[functions](#)

## .txt file and .dat file
A text file = data can be interpreted as characters (letters, numbers, symbols).
A "binary" data file = data can not always be interpreted as something printable on screen.

## .xls file and .csv file
XLS file format is an Excel Sheets binary file format which holds information about all the worksheets in a file, including both content and formatting.
While Excel (XLS and XLSX) file formats are better for storing more complex data, CSV files are supported by nearly all data upload interfaces.
